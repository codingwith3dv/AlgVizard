# Algorithm visualizer
This is an algorithm visualizer made for the theme `Visualization` in Tech With Tim Code jam

It can give you a basic understanding of algorithms
which includes:

* Sorting Algorithms
  * Bubble Sort
  * Quick Sort
  * Merge Sort
  * Insertion Sort
  * Selection Sort
* Binary Search Trees
  * Insertion
  * Deletion
  * Searching
  * Transversal
 * Linked List
   * Insertion
   * Deletion
   * Searching

All algorithms has an animated visualization which also includes a commented pseudo code explanation of the algorithms. It also specifies the space time complexity of each operation.
